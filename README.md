The goal of my experimental simulation was to evaluate the efficiency of various proposed quantum states as they evolve through a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer.

Two main quantum operators were utilized to assess the efficiency -- number operator and parity operator. Parity loss was also calculated.

Both Heisenberg and Schr√∂dinger models were simulated using numerical and symbolic methods to generate the experimental data.

Quantum Fisher Information was considered and generated for reference on the theoretical information maximum.
